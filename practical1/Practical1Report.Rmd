# Coursework and exam performance

We explore the relationship between the performance of students in coursework and their performance in the final exam. We start by loading the data.

```{r DataInput, echo=FALSE}
# Data

```

In the following we fit a simple linear regression model to predict a student's exam mark from their coursework mark. 

<!--- Question 2 & 3 --->

```{r Scatterplot, fig.cap=""}
# Add code here to produce a scatterplot of the data

# Fit a linear model of ex on cw

# Add the fitted regression line to the plot

```

<!--- Add some comments about the scatterplot (Question 3) --->

<!--- Give an illustration and interpretation of the fitted model by answering the questions raised in the practical instructions. (Questions 4 - 6) --->

<!--- Comment on the danger of extrapolation. (Question 7) --->

<!--- Implement and graphically illustrate the new parameterisation of the model. (Question 8-9) -->

```{r Reparameterisation, out.width="49%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap=""}
# Scatterplot illustrating original parameterisation
plot(ex ~ cw, xlab="Coursework mark (out of 20)", ylab="Exam mark (out of 100)", xlim=c(0,20), ylim=c(35,100), col="navy", pch=16, data=Exam)

abline(model1, col="gray20")
exam1.fit <- fitted(model1)
points(exam1.fit ~ cw, col="darkred", pch=18, data=Exam)
legend("bottomright", c("observed response", "fitted values for model 1"), pch=c(1, 18), col=c("navy", "darkred"))
    

# Scatterplot illustrating new parameterisation



```

<!--- Compare the coefficients of the two models (Question 10) -->
